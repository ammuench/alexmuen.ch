Hello! My name is Alex Muench. I'm a software developer with over 12 years of professional experience. I grew up just outside of Chicago, and have been living in the city since 2013.

I have been tinkering with computers and programming since a child, and have been making websites since the days of Geocities. I'm also passionate about marine biology and the environment around us. I pursued both these topics in college, and graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a double major in Environmental Science and Computer Applications.

My career began doing work with various agencies and consulting firms including Acquity Group, Accenture, and and Nerdery. This gave me a broad exposure to many different industries, projects, and techniques in my career. I even spent some time building the Search Results Page and doing some platform work at Walmart.com while I was with Accenture!

I've also been heavily invested in the esports scene. From 2016-2018 I built a software platform and started running the largest amateur Dota 2 league at the time, with over 2500 players across 3 continents. And though I eventually moved on, the experience of running teams and serving international groups of players was exciting and a massive learning experience.

As I moved on from EchoLeague, I helped found GGLeagues, a startup focused on helping local organizations (like park districts and community centers) connect with their communities through esports, where I as the CTO. In this role I architected our web application, managed our devops, grew our tech and product teams, and worked to build a platform that helps bring esports to everyone. It was an incredible experienc where I had opportunities to work in both the tech and business sides of the company, and I learned an incredible amount in the 3+ years I spent working at the company.

After we closed down GGLeagues, I had the startup-bug and joined a few other early stage startups as a staff software engineer before landing at Engine, where I rejoined one of my GGLeagues co-founders as a Staff Front-End Engineer. I currently work on our Lodging Checkout & Postbooking team maintaining our web, mobile-web, and native-mobile applications, have lead several company-wide initiatives (including a full company rebrand), and maintain several internal tools & libraries--including a React form library and an email templating and generation tool.

While my career started primarily doing Front-End/UI Work, I have expanded my skillset over the last 12+ years and am an experinced Full-Stack TypeScript/Javascript developer, with plenty of experience in both UI and Server-based work.

Outside of work, I maintain several open source libraries, a book review website called [PageTern](https://pagetern.app), and am working with a small team on a soon-to-be-released coffee brewing app for native mobile devices.

When I'm not working on software development, I've taken an interest in birding and bird photography. [You can see my photography and progress over on eBird!](https://ebird.org/profile/MTc4NzYzOQ). My partner and I have a dog and two cats that always keep us busy, and I'm also an avid World of Warcraft raider, and have been raid leading my guild for the past 4 years!
