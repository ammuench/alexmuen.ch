I began as an associate level developer (originally at Acquity Group which was acquired by Accenture), working as team members on various client projects, and was promoted up to Senior Front-End Developer where I took on larger team management and project architecture roles. In my last two years I served as a Senior Staff-Augment resource for Walmart Labs, helping build and release multiple features for Walmart.com
