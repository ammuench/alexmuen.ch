I founded, organized, and built the software for the largest Dota 2 Amateur league of its time with over 3000 members. I assembled a team of developers, broadcasters, and community managers to grow the community from the ground up and build a full webapp and software suite to power our competitions. We closed our leagues in 2018 as I moved into my role at GGLeagues and mulitiple other founding members found success within the esports industry in broadcasting, event management, and more.
