I joined Engine as one of the staff front-end leads on developing our client-facing Webapp and Native Mobile App on our massive business travel platform! I'm primarily focused on maintaining and delivering features in our checkout space, but also lead massive internal efforts like building an internal React-based form management system and coordinating our company-wide rebrand from "Hotel Engine" to "Engine" across all of our customer-facing applications and services
