As a Staff Front-End Lead at Engine, I initially focused on developing and maintaining critical client-facing features for our Webapp and Native Mobile App, particularly within the checkout experience of our business travel platform. During this time, I also led significant internal initiatives, including building a company-wide React-based form management system and coordinating the company-wide rebrand across all customer-facing applications and services.
After two years, I transitioned into a Namespace Architect role, where I now provide technical leadership and support to teams across our travel vertical, with a strong emphasis on optimizing application performance and reducing latency
