I started in April of 2018 in a part-time capacity and transition to full-time in February of 2021. My duties included managing the devops & development of our production applications, architecting and building our web applications, and growing and managing our development and tech team at the company. I also helped mentor our junior engineers and was deeply involved with the fundraising process until we sunset the company in June of 2023.
